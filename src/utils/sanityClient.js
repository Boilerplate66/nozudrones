    question: "Do I need a license to fly a sub 250g drone in the UK?",
    shortAnswer: "No, but you do need an Operator ID.",
    detailedAnswer: "Anyone flying a consumer drone for recreational purposes in the UK does not actually need a specific 'license' but must adhere to the Air Navigation Order. However, registration is mandatory for drones weighing between 250 grams and 20 kg (Operator ID) and anyone who flies it needs a Flyer ID, obtained by passing a free online test provided by the CAA. Commercial flyers require an Operational Authorisation.",

    detailedAnswer: "Even if your drone weighs less than 250g, if it is equipped with a camera, you are generally required to register for an Operator ID. This allows authorities to identify the owner in case of an incident. There is an exception if the drone is classified purely as a 'toy' and has no camera or recording capability.",

    detailedAnswer: "Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) is a fundamental safety rule in drone operation. It means the remote pilot must be able to see their drone clearly with their own eyes (without binoculars, telephoto lenses, or electronic viewing equipment like FPV goggles, unless an observer is present). The pilot must have a full view of the surrounding airspace at all times to avoid collisions and monitor for hazards. In the UK, VLOS is typically limited to a maximum horizontal distance of 500 meters.",

    detailedAnswer: "A gimbal is a motorized, multi-axis stabilizing device that holds the drone's camera. Its importance for photography and videography cannot be overstated: it counteracts the drone's movements (pitch, roll, yaw) in real-time, keeping the camera perfectly level and stable. This results in smooth, professional-looking video footage and sharp, blur-free photos, even during dynamic drone maneuvers. Most quality camera drones come equipped with a 3-axis gimbal.",

    detailedAnswer: "Wind resistance is a crucial specification, especially if you plan to fly outdoors frequently. A drone's ability to resist wind directly affects its stability in the air, the smoothness of its footage, and its overall safety. Lighter drones (like the Mini series) are more susceptible to wind, potentially leading to shaky video or even loss of control in strong gusts. Heavier, more powerful drones generally offer better wind resistance.

    detailedAnswer: "The flight controller (FC) is arguably the most important electronic component of a drone, acting as its 'brain.' It receives commands from the remote pilot, processes data from various onboard sensors (like gyroscopes, accelerometers, barometers, GPS), and then sends instructions to the motors (via ESCs) to adjust their speed. This continuous process enables the drone to maintain stability, execute precise maneuvers, and perform advanced functions like hovering, auto-landing, and intelligent flight modes. The quality of the flight controller directly impacts the drone's stability, responsiveness, and overall flight performance.",

They typically cover manufacturing defects and faults that occur under normal use within a specified period (e.g., 1-2 years). However, it's crucial to understand that standard warranties often *do not* cover damage caused by crashes, water immersion, or user error.

    question: "What is 'ActiveTrack' or 'Follow Me' feature on a drone?",
    shortAnswer: "ActiveTrack/Follow Me allows the drone to automatically follow a moving subject without manual control.",
    detailedAnswer: "'ActiveTrack' (DJI's term) or 'Follow Me' is an intelligent flight mode that enables the drone to automatically recognize, lock onto, and follow a moving subject (e.g., a person, vehicle, or animal). The drone uses its vision sensors and advanced algorithms to maintain a set distance and angle from the subject while recording. This feature is incredibly useful for solo content creators, capturing dynamic action shots, or for applications like sports filming where the pilot needs to focus on the subject rather than constantly maneuvering the drone. Obstacle avoidance systems are crucial for safe operation in these modes.",

    question: "Are propeller guards necessary, and when should I use them?",
    shortAnswer: "Propeller guards are highly recommended for beginners or indoor flying to protect props and prevent injury.",
    detailedAnswer: "Propeller guards are plastic or carbon fiber rings that surround the drone's propellers. They are highly recommended, especially for **beginners** who are still learning to fly, or for **indoor flying**. Their primary benefits are: 1. **Protection:** They prevent propellers from hitting obstacles (walls, branches) which can cause damage to the drone or lead to a crash. 2. **Safety:** They reduce the risk of injury to people or pets from spinning blades. While they can add weight and slightly reduce flight time, the added protection and safety are often worth it, particularly when flying in confined spaces or around others.",

    question: "Are there specific safety features to look for in a drone for beginners?",
    shortAnswer: "Yes, look for GPS stabilization, obstacle avoidance, Return-to-Home (RTH), and propeller guards.",
    detailedAnswer: "For beginners, several safety features can make the learning process much safer and more enjoyable: 1. **GPS Stabilization:** Allows the drone to hold its position accurately, making it much easier to hover and control. 2. **Obstacle Avoidance Sensors:** These (ultrasonic, infrared, visual) detect nearby obstacles and can automatically brake or navigate around them, greatly reducing collision risk. 3. **Return-to-Home (RTH):** Automatically brings the drone back to its takeoff point if signal is lost or battery is low. 4. **Propeller Guards:** Protect the propellers from minor impacts and reduce the risk of injury. 5. **Beginner Mode:** Limits speed and range for a more controlled learning experience.",

    question: "What are 'Intelligent Flight Modes' and why are they useful?",
    shortAnswer: "Intelligent Flight Modes are automated features (e.g., Follow Me, Orbit) that simplify complex shots and maneuvers.",
    detailedAnswer: "Intelligent Flight Modes (or Smart Flight Modes) are pre-programmed automated flight patterns that simplify complex camera movements and make flying easier. Examples include: **Follow Me** (drone tracks a moving subject), **Orbit** (drone circles a point of interest), **Waypoint Navigation** (drone flies a pre-set path), **ActiveTrack** (advanced subject tracking), and **QuickShots** (pre-programmed cinematic movements). These modes are extremely useful for beginners to capture professional-looking footage and for experienced pilots to execute precise, repeatable shots with less manual effort.",

    detailedAnswer: "Drone propellers are critical for safe and efficient flight. It's recommended to replace them every 50 hours of flight time or every 200 flights, whichever comes first. Always inspect propellers for any cracks, chips, bends, or damage before each flight, and replace immediately if any imperfections are found, as even minor damage can affect stability and safety.",
